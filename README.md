**Attention!** with update to layer 167, JSON output format got some important changes, [check them out](https://github.com/3bl3gamer/tg_history_dumper/releases/tag/v0.167.0).

# Telegram History Dumper

[中文](./README_zh.md)

Exports messages (as [JSON](#format)) and media from specified dialogs, groups and channels.

It gets only new (after already fetched) messages and resumes file downloads (if interrupted).

It works as a Telegram client. So yes, you will have to enter you phone, confirmation code and password (if any).

It **will not fetch channel comments**. If you need them, you should join channel's dicussion group.

## Installing

```
go install github.com/3bl3gamer/tg_history_dumper@latest
tg_history_dumper [args]
```

Or
```
git clone https://github.com/3bl3gamer/tg_history_dumper
cd tg_history_dumper
go build
./tg_history_dumper [args]
```

## Usage

### Preparing

`app_id` and `app_hash` must be obtained from Telegram. More info at https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id#obtaining-api-id

### Simple

```tg_history_dumper -app-id=12345 -app-hash=abcdefg```

It will ask credentials, save session to `tg.session` file and download all dialogs (without media) to `history` folder.

### Config

...is read from `config.json`, different file may be provided via `-config` [argument](#arguments).

Format:
```json
{
    "app_id": 12345,
    "app_hash": "abcdefg",
    "socks5_proxy_addr": "127.0.0.1:9050",
    "socks5_proxy_user": "hackyhack",
    "socks5_proxy_password": "passw0rd",
    "request_interval_ms": 1000,
    "session_file_path": "tg.session",
    "out_dir_path": "history",
    "history": [
        "all",
        {"exclude": {"type": "channel"}},
        {"username": "my_channel"}
    ],
    "stories": "none",
    "media": [
        {"type": "user"},
        {"username": "my_channel"}
    ],
    "history_limit": {
        "5000": [
            "all",
            {"exclude": {"type": "user"}}
        ]
    },
    "dump_account": "off",
    "dump_contacts": "off",
    "dump_sessions": "off"
}
```

* `app_id` and `app_hash` — see [preparing](#preparing);
* `socks5_proxy_addr` — (optional) `address:post` of SOCKS5 proxy;
* `socks5_proxy_user` — (optional) username for SOCKS5 proxy (if auth is required);
* `socks5_proxy_password` — (optional) password for SOCKS5 proxy (if auth is required);
* `request_interval_ms` — (optional, default is 1000) interval for requesting history message chunks (may be decreased, though it likely will not speed up the process, since TG has query rate limits);
* `session_file_path` — (optional, default is `tg.session`) session file location (you will not have to login next time if it is present);
* `out_dir_path` — (optional, default is `history`) folder for saved messages and media;
* `history` — (optional, default is `{"type": "user"}`) chat filtering [rules](#rules);
* `stories` — (optional, default is `"none"`) [stories](#stories) filtering [rules](#rules);
* `media` — (optional, default is `"none"`) chat media filtering [rules](#rules), only applies to chats matched to `history` rules and to stories matched to `stories` rules;
* `history_limit` — (optional, default is `{}`) new chat [history limiting](#history-limits) rules;
* `dump_account` — (optional, default is `"off"`, use `"write"` to enable dump) dumps basic account information to file, does not apply when `-list-chats` enabled;
* `dump_contacts` — (optional, default is `"off"`, use `"write"` to enable dump) dumps contacts information to file, does not apply when `-list-chats` enabled;
* `dump_sessions` — (optional, default is `"off"`, use `"write"` to enable dump) dumps active sessions to file, does not apply when `-list-chats` enabled.

If config has non-empty `app_id` and `app_hash`, dump may be updated just with `tg_history_dumper` (without arguments).

### Stories

Currently, stories are saved from user's/channel's public "posts" tab and (if accessible) from stories archive. Recent stories with the "Post to My Profile" switch turned off will not be saved.

Stories dumping is relatively slow, so there is a `-skip-stories` flag to bypass stories saving as if `config.stories` was set to `"none"`.

[History limits](#history-limits) do not affect stories.

### History limits

Limits define how many messages will be dumped for chats for the first time.
They are configured as limit_count:[rules](#rules).
If chat matches more than one rule, the lower limit is applied.
If chat does not match any rules, all messages are dumped.
If there are already some messages from previous dump for the chat, its limits are ignored.

For example, this config sets limit to 5000 for groups, 10000 for channels, dialogs remain unlimited:

```json
"history_limit": {
    "5000": {"type": "group"},
    "10000": {"type": "channel"}
}
```

### Rules

Rules used to accept/reject specific chats (or media in these chats).
Chat/file is accepted if it matches to some rules and not later excluded by others. Everything is rejected by default.

For example, this rule accepts only dialogs:

```json
"history": {"type": "user"}
```

Accepts all chats except channels:

```json
"history": [
    "all",
    {"exclude": {"type": "channel"}}
]
```

Accepts all media from dialogs and group chats but group media size is limited to 500 MiB:

```json
"media": [
    {"type": "user"},
    {"type": "group", "media_max_size": "500M"}
]
```

Accepts all media from dialogs and two groups, groups media size is limited to 500 MiB:

```json
"media": [
    {"type": "user"},
    {"only": [
        {"title": "Group A"},
        {"title": "Group B"},
    ], "with": {"media_max_size": "500M"}}
]
```

`only`-rule may be rewritten as:
```json
{"title": "Group A", "media_max_size": "500M"},
{"title": "Group B", "media_max_size": "500M"}
```

#### Attributes rule

```json
{
    "id": 123,
    "title": "Name",
    "username": "uname",
    "type": "user",
    "media_max_size": "500M"
}
```

Matches chat/file by all provided attributes.
* `id` can be obtained from [chats list](#listing-chats);
* `title` for users is `"FirstName LastName"`;
* `type` may be `"user"`, `"group"` or `"channel"`;
* `media_max_size` is only used in `config.media` and must be in form `"500M"`, `"500K"` or `"500"` (for bytes).

#### Exclude rule

```json
{"exclude": "inner rule"}
```
Excludes chats/files from match even if they matched some previous rule.

#### List rule

```json
["rule0", "rule1", "more rules"]
```
Applies inner rules one by one.

#### Only rule

```json
{"only": "only-rule", "with": "with-rule"}
```

Tries `with-rule` only if `only-rule` matched.

#### All rule

```json
"all"
```

Matches everything.

#### None rule

```json
"none"
```

Matches nothing.

### Listing chats

`tg_history_dumper -list-chats`

Outputs chats in format `<type> <id> <limit> <title> (<username>)`.
Title for users is `FirstName LastName`.
If chat does not match `config.history` rules, the line is grayed out.

### Arguments

Some arguments override values from `config`.
For example `-chat='Some Chat'` may be used to override `config.history`
and update messages only from `Some Chat`.

## Format

### Messages

All messages are saved as JSON Lines (aka jsonl) to file `history/<id>_<title>`. Dumper searches directories only by id and renames folder when title is changed.

Each JSON object has special field `"_"` with type name. Outermost objects has one more special field `"_TL_LAYER"` with layer number (API version). For example:

```json
{"Date":1601491406,"Message":"Hello World!","PeerID":{"ChannelID":1261507434,"_":"TL_peerChannel"},"_":"TL_message","_TL_LAYER":119}
```
(some message fields were removed for readability)

### Peers

Related users and chats (aka peers) are saved to `history/users` and `history/chats` respectively. Each file is JSON Lines with some basic user/chat data like id, usrname, first/lastname, title, etc.

Lines are added not only when new peer is encountered but also when existing peer data (title for example) has changed compared to previous dump. So same users/chats may appear multiple times there. The last record for each id is the most recent one.

This applies only to users/chats *own* fields (name, phone, etc.). History messages are saved only once, edit/deletion is not detected.
